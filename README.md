# Interpreter

## Description
This class is responsible for interpreting and executing simple Ruby-like programming language scripts. It handles tokens generated by the `Tokenizer`, maintains variable storage and executes statements based on token types.

## fields
* tokens - `List<Token> tokens` stores a list of tokens produced by the `Tokenizer` and these tokens represent the parsed input code.
* current token index - `currentTokenIndex` keeps track of the current position in the tokens list.
* variables - `variables` instanceof `VariableStorage` used to manage variable assignments and retrievals.

## constructor
* `Interpreter(String input)` - initializes the interpreter with the given input string.
* creates a `Tokenizer` to parse the input into tokens.
* initializes the `tokens` list with the result from `tokenizer.tokenize()`.
* sets `currentTokenIndex` to 0, to begin at the first token.
* instantiates `VariableStorage` for managing variables.

## private methods
* `getCurrentToken()` - returns the current token at the current index without advancing.
* `getNextToken()` - returns the token at the current index and then advances to the next token.
* `checkTokenType(String expectedType)` - ensures that current token type matches the expected type, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException()` if it doesn't.
* `executeStatement()` - processes a single statement by determining the type of the current token.
* `handleAssignment(Token identifierToken)` - manages variable assignment.
* `handleIf()` - processes if statmenets.
* `handleWhile()` - processes while statements.
* `handlePuts()` - processes `puts` statements by evaluating and printing the result.
* `executeBlock()` - executes statements within a block until encouranting an `end` or a closing brace.
* `skipBlock()` - skips over a block of code without execution which is useful for conditions which were not met.
* `handleBreak()` - throws a `BreakException` to exit from loops.
* `eval()` - evaluates expressions. handling literals (numbers, strings), variables.

## execute method
`execute()` - the main execution loop of the interpreter which processes statements until the end of the file `EOF` is reached.
